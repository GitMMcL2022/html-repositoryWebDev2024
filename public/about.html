<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Michael a very late entrant to Web Development. I never imagined I could learn HTML
  and how to create a Webpage.  My main reason for learning about Web Development is to update my IT skills and perhaps begin
  offering these skills to small businesses here and in the U.S.A.. 
  The way my brain is wired means understanding how a web page is created is fundamental (for me,)
   to learning  Web Development.I will update my About page as and when I make more progress.  


<p>My background is working in IT as a Contractor for over twenty years.
  I worked for all sizes of organisations from start-ups to a major outsourcing company. I have 
worked in a wide variety of organisations from Government Departments both national and local, 
to Financial, Automotive and Pharmacuetical.    </p>

<p>I will be offering small businesses a tailor-made solution so they can 
  be marketed to local people both B2B and B2C.  </p>
