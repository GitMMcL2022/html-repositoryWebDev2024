 <h2>My Best 3 Movies of my time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Kelly's Heroes</h3>
 <p>Favourite War Movie - All Star Cast and Dustin Hoffman (Oddball,) and, Gavin Macleod 
  (Moriarty,) are hilarious along with   Clint Eastwood, Don Rickles Telly Savalas,  Stuart Margolin, 
  Karl-Otto Alberty (the Tank Commandander who must have had a ard time keeping his face straight when he saw Savalas, Eastwood and Rickles 
  approaching his tank and asking him to blow open the door to the bank.) 
 </p>
<h3>Paint Your Wagon </h3>
 <p>- Another brilliant cast, Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood, Jean Seeberg, 
  Harve Presnell and Ray Walston,  the bit at the end where the mule goes on the ramapge
  through the mines under the town still cracks me up. </p>
  <h3>The Quiet Man</h3>
  <p>John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Barry Fitzgerald, Victor McLagen, what a cast.  
    It painted a picture of a long forgotten Ireland but also told a few home 
    truths about people returning to Ireland after being in America </p>
